# Data description
I hope to identify barriers and facilitators for various healthcare providers in recommending physical activity for their patients who have disabilities. There is a disparity in people with disabilities engaging in physical activity compared to non-disabled people. The literature has highlighted that interactions with various healthcare providers may contribute to decreased physical activity engagement in this population.

# Roles and responsibilities
Data management roles for my project include data collection/generation, data coding, data organization, protection of sensitive and protected data, data analysis and data archiving and preservation. The research team for this project will be relatively small, consisting of a PI, graduate student, two undergraduate students. The PI will assist mainly in a supervisory role and will be available to provide assistance with any role but will not be assigned to anything specific. The graduate student will be in charge of every role but will be solely in charge of data collection/generation, and data analysis. The graduate student will develop the initial coding, organization, protection, and arching/ preservation, but will then delegate the duties to the undergraduate students once a systematic process is developed. 

# Data standards and metadata
The data will be collected by using surveys or interviews to ask what these healthcare providers experience working with people with disabilities is and how they perceive their interactions went. Then I would need to identify what works well and what they report they need to increase their ability to recommend various types of physical activity for various people with disabilities. # Storage and security

# Storage and Security 
During the project, data will be saved in a lab in a file cabinet under lock and key since it will be done on paper. It will be retained by the PI for a minimum of 7 years. Data will be transfered to an excel spreadsheet and coded. Once transfered, the hardcopy of the data will remain locked in a file cabinet and will be accessible to memebers of the research team for reference. The automated data will be saved on a desktop on a computer and on a protable hardrive that will be stored in a cabinet when it is not in use. If any changes are made to the data on the hard drive or the desktop then that new file must be available on both. 

# Access and data sharing
Data will be available only for use within the lab untill everything is analyzed.

# Archiving and preservation
Data will be uploaded to a data sharing sight to give other researches a chance to explore the data to answer any questions they may have in regards to healthcare providers and people with disabilities.
